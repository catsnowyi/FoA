# FoA: Abstract
Fall of Artica（FoA) is an Alternate Reality Critical Action Game that originated from a G11 Visual Art class at the University of Toronto Schools(UTS),  Joined by a Grade 7 English Teacher, the FoA game curriculum is designed to align with the curriculum expectations across all STEAM subjects. Through independent and group game-based learning environments, students will be challenged to complete story-based missions and engage their critical thinking and problem-solving skills across the STEAM curriculum.
In the dystopian world of Artica, students will collectively engage in inquiry about pressing social-political issues of the future dystopian society. The Six distinct governance entities (Upper Nuoveratica, Lower Nuovartica, Fortress, Mirror City, Fon Bay, and Crescent Garden)  that make up the dystopian world of Artica provide abundant opportunities for students to develop their critical literacy as they contribute ideas and artifacts to an OpenSource Alternate Reality Critical Action Game.
 Interaction with AI-empowered Non-Player Characters (NPCs), students will gain real-time feedback to accomplish their missions. Guided by theories and practices of critical making, students will gain critical literacy and critical maker identity through structured, playful interactions. 
# 1. Components of a vibrant maker community:
1) The Shared Economy Principle. Sharing resources like knowledge, skills, or time creates value for everyone involved in a communal setting. By applying this principle, teachers can encourage collaborative learning and problem-solving among students, fostering a strong community of practice.
2) The Open Source Paradigm. Originating in the tech world, the open-source ethos values free access to knowledge. In a classroom setting, this translates to sharing educational resources, research findings, and project results freely among peers, promoting continuous improvement and communal ownership of knowledge.
3) The Importance of Critical Making. Merging hands-on production with critical thought enables students to scrutinize their creations' societal and ethical dimensions. Through this process, students become more aware creators, thinking critically about the impact of their work.
4) Integrating the Game Elements: Building a Community of Practice. 
5) Resource Pooling: Students can establish a communal pool of valuable resources by adopting principles from the shared economy.
6) Open Collaboration: Taking cues from the open-source culture, collaborative projects can be made transparent and open for collective critique and refinement.
7) Reflective Creation: By applying the critical-making framework, students can engage in projects requiring technical skills and critical reflection on societal implications.
8) Peer-to-Peer Learning: Students are encouraged to assume roles interchangeably as learners or mentors depending on their expertise and the project's needs.
9) Inclusive Dialogue: Inclusive conversations that welcome multiple perspectives can deepen the community's collective understanding.
10) In-game Assessment: Transforming assessments into communal activities, like collecting achievements and knowledge base, fosters a community culture of sharing through collective inquiry and critical making. 
# 2. Co-designer Roles:
a. Students: Player and maker of the game(art).

b. Teachers: integrating game elements with pedagogy.
   
In the Fall of Artica (FoA) scenario, teachers adopt a new role, stepping away from being the center of the classroom. They transition into the roles of facilitators and Dungeon Masters (DM) of the FoA game.

Teachers are the leaders of the unique FoA game culture, where students do not compete with each other but instead collaborate to solve creative problems. The teacher would be responsible for building open communication among students and facilitating whenever conflict arises in conversations and debates. In FoA games, students' personal experiences and cultural backgrounds are seen as an asset for building a diverse, culturally responsive knowledge society. Students are also valued for their expertise and skills in a team. 

As facilitators, they also establish the NPCs and Missions, preparing a world for students to explore. They provide prompts and support when students grapple with challenges or encounter creative blocks.

Additionally, they act as the DMs, guiding the whole class and small group interactions. This encompasses facilitating brainstorming sessions, managing peer feedback, encouraging reflection, and coordinating 'show and tell' activities.
c. Designers: Support teachers with research-backed methods like scaffolding and differentiated instruction within game dynamics.
d. Technological Tools: Augmented reality, IoT, and AI can enhance the gaming experience.
e. Active Learning Spaces: Physical classroom design can become a part of the learning experience.
f. Game Elements: materials to make meaningful interactions, get immediate feedback, and motivate collaboration. 
g. Maker activities: Allows students to co-design and co-constructing meaning.

<b>3.4 Quest Card </b>
<br>It could be an individual Questor “submission” of a series of missions following a sequential order.  
<br>There are Six Quest archetypes:
<br>A.Inquiry: individual contribution to the shared knowledge base (responsibility)
<br>B.Co-design: brainstorming, solutions (perspective and representations)

<b>3.5 Mission Cards </b>

# 4. Game Overview 

Fall of Artica is a narrative-driven card and board game that follows the early phases of the hero’s journey, separated into three distinct “missions”. During these missions, students will create their own characters and work in separate groups to find the elixir to their hero’s journey in a teamwork-oriented card game. Each group will engage with one unique region of Artica. Each student will be their own “hero” in their own hero’s journey while simultaneously taking on roles as sidekicks for the other students in the group. The rules surrounding roleplay are open for interpretation, so players may roleplay as whatever roles they see fit.

<b> 4.1 The Intro Loop: Inner-Group Interactions</b>
- <b>Character Roll-Up</b>

<br> <b>Complete Character Sheet</b>
<br><br> a. Each student will receive a character sheet on which they can name their character and draw an image depicting their fictional character in the world of Artica.
<br> b. Each student will roll four (4) six-sided dice. They may choose three (3) of these rolled numbers and apply them, in any sequence, to any of the three attributes belonging to their character (Strength/Charisma/Wisdom).
<br> c. Each student will then receive a random colored token. These tokens represent the student’s associated region. The students will also receive playmats, card decks, and missions specific to their associated region’s narrative.

<br>Introduction to Basic Rules
Students will be introduced to the various decks in the game:
<br><b>Resource Deck </b>
<br>Players draw from this deck at the beginning of each turn
<br><b>Trader Deck </b>
<br>Players reveal the top 3 trader cards
<br>Students will be introduced to the social chatbot (ConvAI) aspect of Fall of Artica.

<br>Separate into Region-based Groups
<br>After separating into their assigned regions/factions, students will each receive an “Adventure Pouch”.
<br><b>Adventure Pouch </b>
<br>Adventure Pouches each have <b>1 Quest card and 5 Resource cards. Adventure Pouches will also be a way to store cards in between sessions.</b>

<br>Introduction to turn-by-turn mechanics 
<br><br>At the beginning of each turn, students:
<br> i. Draw a card from the Resource Deck
<br> ii. Gain 2 Bits (Currency)
<br> iii. Use Bits to trade up to one (1) card with the Trader
<br><br>Students may now:
<br> i. Talk amongst themselves to come up with a game strategy for the current Mission
<br> ii. Play cards and follow their written instructions to complete Missions
<br> iii. Trade Traits with one another up to one (1) time per class

- <b>Pick a problem</b>

<br> Players can look at the Quest card they received and the teacher then explains the game rules.
<br> Quests can be completed by spending resource cards to craft other cards needed to complete the story.
<br> Cards will be combined logically.
<br> Players will also receive a crafting recipe page that tells them what they need for each mission.

<b>Mission 1: Exposition</b>
<br> Students will be introduced to Mission 1. Mission 1 will include 3 sections:

Section 1: Crafting Resources
<br>Players will spend resource cards that match with crafting recipes to create new cards that will assist them in completing the mission. Once these cards have been crafted, players will unlock the next section.
<br>e.g. Players have reached a huge waterfall and need to cross it to continue
<br> - craft bridges, boats, etc

Section 2: Converse with AI
<br>Players will receive a secret phrase once they have completed the first section of Mission 1 that they can enter into ConvAI to unlock the next section of Mission 1.
<br><b>OR</b>
<br> Players must figure out the secret phrase using hints from their first section as the puzzle for section 2
<br> - This section will be largely focused on conversing with the chatbot

Section 3: 
<br>This section will require students to engage with one other group in order to locate a MacGuffin. Likewise, one other group will come to find students in the current group. The MacGuffin could be hidden in decks or even in the physical vicinity of other groups.

<b>4.2 Gameplay Loops: Group-to-Group interactions </b>

- <b>Mining resources and information using Activity Log </b>
<br> Players receive resources in a few different ways:
<br> - Hidden “caches” around the classroom (card amount is equal to how many students are in that group)
<br> - Players each draw 3 cards from the Resource Deck every time a play session begins
<br> - When completing a Quest, players each draw cards equal to how many points a Quest was worth

- <b>Circulate or Consume resources </b>
<br> - Players receive resources in a few different ways:
<br> - Completing Quests will consume the resource cards and thus, resource cards cannot be reused
<br> - Rolling dice to determine the character would complete the part of the mission 

- <b>Finish mission </b>
<br> - Each Quest Card has a story once completed

- <b>Collect rewards </b>
<br> - Quest rewards
<br> e.g. Caught By Security can reward the players with a Secret Key. The Secret Key allows them to form the information bridge to Mirror City.
<br> - Players draw cards equal to the Quest's Point value
<br> - do players need to complete all their quests in 1 day? since the game will only be brought out 3 times in total

<b>4.3 The Final loop : Whole class interaction </b> 

- <b>Reflect on your information</b>
<br> - Decided through in-class activity
<br> - the Final Quest is a collaborative effort shared between all team members
<br>  · could be split into 3 separate "phases," like a final boss fight 

- <b> Assemble resource </b>
<br> - Use their new information link to Mirror City to exchange cards to complete the final Quest

- <b>Resolve the problem or present a new problem </b>
<br> - Denouement of storyline
<br> - Players receive the climactic ending for their team's Questline
<br> - Teams may have some time to talk to other teams and talk about their storylines
<br>   · could it be an in-class activity or homework? Encourage empathy and communication by talking to one another about their “hero’s journey.”

# 5. Missions & Feedback

<b>5.1 Upper Nuovartica: Surveillance Culture</b>

The Restoration Party leaders held power by manipulating information based on the lessons learned from earlier historical examples (propaganda, etc.).  The “Big Leader” has high popularity amongst the citizens of Upper Nuovartica, telling them that they are the real victims and that the rest of the world is out to destroy what we are all trying to protect.  This disinformation is supported by a campaign to discredit any opposing views as “fake news” and “deep fake” by the revolutionaries.  Surveillance is at an all-time high, and all members of Upper Nuovartica are encouraged to report anyone expressing any ideas of dissent.

Some citizens are becoming nervous that these ideas are false, but they cannot get together or organize.  All journalists and media have been locked down.  The citizens of upper Nuovartica desperately need a secure network for communication, particularly with the outside world.  They need： 

1)Media literacy to identify the truth from misinformation;
2)Journalism to hold government accountable

<b>Analogous：</b>

the real world: Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell - information confusion, post-truth, with corporate agendas making the wealthy wealthier and the masses kept in an uproar over their identity politics (Trump makes them worried about immigrants, etc.

- Alex Jones and Infowars
- In Dystopian fiction:  George Orwell‘s novels  (any dystopian novel you are reading - reflection)
- Dystopian Film: Minority Report  “Thoughtcrime” 

<b>Quest：</b>
- Poke holes in the disinformation
- Organize a way to hold critical discussions
- Organize events or gatherings to allow dissent and sharing
- Socially engaged art (demonstrate ideas)
- Ask questions to the public 
<br> - How are news articles created?  What is the fact-checking process, sources, etc.”
<br> - Who funds the newspapers?
<br> - Who are the stakeholders?  
<br> - Can we have a democratic society without a reliable source of news?
<br> - What can individuals do when they are doubting some piece of information?
<br> - What happens when a friend, family, or trusted person sends you something you don’t trust?
<br> - How can we communicate with those who are deeply brainwashed? 
<br> - Is there “one truth”
<br> - How can we tell if something is true?  Can we trust pictures?

<b>Homework</b>

- Mission 1: familiar with theme, understand elixer

Homework - some readings about censorship, surveillance

1) <b> Understanding theme (surveillance)</b>

<br>Narrate your character, around several questions
<br> - What are your most important things the government can provide
<br> - What are your worries

2) <b> Debate Some questions</b>
<br> -Face Recognition
<br> -Location data
<br> -Social networks
<br> -Tracking cameras
<br> -Save all search data
<br> -Reporting friends - cancel
<br> -Censorship

3)<b> We’ve been invited to attend a secret meeting, where we will decide on some specific priorities about privacy concerns, and we need to decide our top 3 to requests, and also need to figure out how to have this meeting </b>

4)<b> Ask Ymir </b>
<br> -What are some questions we can ask Ymir, to help us understand the challenges of setting up a free 

 Add: possible surveillance card (one can look at others’ cards)
<br> Pro: evidence for surveillance (enemies, gun violence - I feell safer to being watched
<br> Cons:
